A novel by Steven Simcox

### Chapter 1
#### Roots

I wasn't sure what I was looking for. Maybe a nice rock to play with. Or to sit on. A branch to walk with. Maybe to swing around. A tree to climb. It didn't matter. I was just trying to waste my time so I didn't have to sit around camp any longer than I had to.  
 
 The first weeks out the camp was filled with excitement. Some of the young men bragged about the impact they would have on the war. Some of the older men told the lighter (and perhaps hyperbolic) stories of personal triumph. The air was thick with glory and pride.  
 
 It had been fifteen years since the last war. Often referred to as "The War of Lakes", it was fought in its entirety in enemy territory. King James received a letter threatening his life if he didn't surrender the land surrounding the three lakes on the east side of our nation to Emperor Richard, our neighbor to the east. Like any proud ruler, James decided the preemptive strike was the only one worth applying in the situation. In a month we had an army knocking on the door of the Mendelian's westernmost metropolis with virtually no resistance. Richard surrendered all of the land we had gone through and opened that city to our merchants. His Majesty Was pleased with the outcome. It took him a month to end a war (that he arguably started) gaining a foothold into a nation that was previously completely shut off to him.  
 
 The current war was vastly different.  
 
 Emperor Richard invaded with no warning. King James scrambled troops quickly, though, and we were able to stand toe to toe against the enemy. After my camps first engagement we were feeling good. We drove the enemy back losing ten men of one thousand. That first battle was at the south lake. It appeared that we would have similar success to the first war. But the second wave was different. Among the enemy troops were men with strength we were unaware existed. Their skin was tinted green and eyes were blood red. We forced them back a second time, but did not fare as well as the first. Just over three hundred men were lost. Many of the boys predicting glorious futures found death. The camp was now filled with tension and fear. The green men stuck in memories, in nightmares. And I became acutely aware of my own cowardice.  
 And so I found myself wandering the forest around the lake, looking for anything to distract me from camp.
